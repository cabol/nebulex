**Nebulex** provides support for transparently adding caching into an existing
Elixir application. Similar to [Ecto][ecto], the caching abstraction allows
consistent use of various caching solutions with minimal impact on the code.

**Nebulex** enables the implementation of different
[cache usage patterns][cache_patterns],
[distributed cache topologies][cache_topologies],
and more.

for more information.

## Usage

You need to add `nebulex` as a dependency to your `mix.exs` file. However, in
the case you want to use an external (a non built-in adapter) cache adapter,
you also have to add the proper dependency to your `mix.exs` file.

The supported caches and their adapters are:

Nebulex Adapter                    | Dependency
:----------------------------------| :------------------------------------------
[Nebulex.Adapters.Local][la]       | Built-In
[Nebulex.Adapters.Partitioned][pa] | Built-In
[Nebulex.Adapters.Replicated][ra]  | Built-In
[Nebulex.Adapters.Multilevel][ma]  | Built-In
NebulexRedisAdapter                | [nebulex_redis_adapter][nebulex_redis_adapter]
NebulexMemcachedAdapter            | [nebulex_memcached_adapter][nebulex_memcached_adapter]
NebulexFdbAdapter                  | [nebulex_fdb_adapter][nebulex_fdb_adapter]

[pa]: http://hexdocs.pm/nebulex/Nebulex.Adapters.Partitioned.html
[ra]: http://hexdocs.pm/nebulex/Nebulex.Adapters.Replicated.html
[ma]: http://hexdocs.pm/nebulex/Nebulex.Adapters.Multilevel.html
[nebulex_redis_adapter]: https://github.com/cabol/nebulex_redis_adapter
[nebulex_memcached_adapter]: https://github.com/vasuadari/nebulex_memcached_adapter
[nebulex_fdb_adapter]: https://github.com/fire/nebulex_fdb_adapter

For example, if you want to use a built-in cache, add to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:nebulex, "~> 2.0"},
    {:decorator, "~> 1.3"}
  ]
end
```

> The `:decorator` dependency is for enabling the
  [cache decorators](http://hexdocs.pm/nebulex/Nebulex.Decorators.html).

Then run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch the dependencies. If you want to
use another cache adapter, just choose the proper dependency from the table
above.

Finally, in the cache definition, you will need to specify the `adapter`
respective to the chosen dependency. For the local built-in cache it is:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Cache do
  use Nebulex.Cache,
    otp_app: :my_app,
    adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Local,
    backend: :shards
  ...
```

## Testing

Testing by default spawns nodes internally for distributed tests.
To run tests that do not require clustering, exclude  the `clustered` tag:

```
$ mix test --exclude clustered
```

If you have issues running the clustered tests try running:

```
$ epmd -daemon
```

before running the tests.

## Benchmarks

Some basic benchmarks were added using [benchee](https://github.com/PragTob/benchee);
to learn more, check out the [benchmarks](./benchmarks) directory.

To run the benchmarks:

```
$ MIX_ENV=test mix run benchmarks/benchmark.exs
```

If you are interested to run more sophisticated load tests, perhaps you should
checkout the [Nebulex Load Tests](https://github.com/cabol/nebulex_examples/tree/master/nebulex_bench)
example, it allows you to run your own performance/load tests against Nebulex,
and it also comes with load tests results.

## Contributing

Contributions to Nebulex are very welcome and appreciated!

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cabol/nebulex/issues) for bug reports
or feature requests. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/cabol/nebulex/pulls)
when you are ready to contribute.

When submitting a pull request you should not update the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md),
and also make sure you test your changes thoroughly, include unit tests
alongside new or changed code.

Before to submit a PR it is highly recommended to run:

 * `mix test` to run tests
 * `mix coveralls.html && open cover/excoveralls.html` to run tests and check
   out code coverage (expected 100%).
 * `mix format && mix credo --strict` to format your code properly and find code
   style issues
 * `mix dialyzer` to run dialyzer for type checking; might take a while on the
   first invocation
