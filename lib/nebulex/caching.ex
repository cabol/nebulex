    Declarative annotation-based caching via function
    [decorators](https://github.com/arjan/decorator).

    For caching declaration, the abstraction provides three Elixir function
    decorators: `cacheable `, `cache_evict`, and `cache_put`, which allow
    functions to trigger cache population or cache eviction.
    Let us take a closer look at each annotation.

    > Inspired by [Spring Cache Abstraction](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html).

    ## `cacheable` decorator

    As the name implies, `cacheable` is used to demarcate functions that are
    cacheable - that is, functions for whom the result is stored into the cache
    so, on subsequent invocations (with the same arguments), the value in the
    cache is returned without having to actually execute the function. In its
    simplest form, the decorator/annotation declaration requires the name of
    the cache associated with the annotated function:

        @decorate cacheable(cache: Cache)
        def get_account(id) do
          # the logic for retrieving the account ...
        end

    In the snippet above, the function `get_account/1` is associated with the
    cache named `Cache`. Each time the function is called, the cache is checked
    to see whether the invocation has been already executed and does not have
    to be repeated.

    ### Default Key Generation

    Since caches are essentially key-value stores, each invocation of a cached
    function needs to be translated into a suitable key for cache access.
    Out of the box, the caching abstraction uses a simple key-generator
    based on the following algorithm: `:erlang.phash2({module, func_name})`.

    ### Custom Key Generation Declaration

    Since caching is generic, it is quite likely the target functions have
    various signatures that cannot be simply mapped on top of the cache
    structure. This tends to become obvious when the target function has
    multiple arguments out of which only some are suitable for caching
    (while the rest are used only by the function logic). For example:

        @decorate cacheable(cache: Cache)
        def get_account(email, include_users?) do
          # the logic for retrieving the account ...
        end

    At first glance, while the boolean argument influences the way the account
    is found, it is no use for the cache.

    For such cases, the `cacheable` decorator allows the user to specify the
    key explicitly based on the function attributes.

        @decorate cacheable(cache: Cache, key: {Account, email})
        def get_account(email, include_users?) do
          # the logic for retrieving the account ...
        end

        @decorate cacheable(cache: Cache, key: {Account, user.account_id})
        def get_user_account(%User{} = user) do
          # the logic for retrieving the account ...
        end

    It is also possible passing options to the cache, like so:

        @decorate cacheable(cache: Cache, key: {Account, email}, opts: [ttl: 300_000])
        def get_account(email, include_users?) do
          # the logic for retrieving the account ...
        end

    See the **"Shared Options"** section below.

    ### Functions with multiple clauses

    Since [decorator lib](https://github.com/arjan/decorator#functions-with-multiple-clauses)
    is used, it is important to be aware of the recommendations, warns,
    limitations, and so on. In this case, for functions with multiple clauses
    the general advice is to create an empty function head, and call the
    decorator on that head, like so:

        @decorate cacheable(cache: Cache, key: email)
        def get_account(email \\ nil)

        def get_account(nil), do: nil

        def get_account(email) do
          # the logic for retrieving the account ...
        end

    ## `cache_put` decorator

    For cases where the cache needs to be updated without interfering with the
    function execution, one can use the `cache_put` decorator. That is, the
    method will always be executed and its result placed into the cache
    (according to the `cache_put` options). It supports the same options as
    `cacheable`.

        @decorate cache_put(cache: Cache, key: {Account, acct.email})
        def update_account(%Account{} = acct, attrs) do
          # the logic for updating the account ...
        end

    Note that using `cache_put` and `cacheable` annotations on the same function
    is generally discouraged because they have different behaviors. While the
    latter causes the method execution to be skipped by using the cache, the
    former forces the execution in order to execute a cache update. This leads
    to unexpected behavior and with the exception of specific corner-cases
    (such as decorators having conditions that exclude them from each other),
    such declarations should be avoided.

    ## `cache_evict` decorator

    The cache abstraction allows not just the population of a cache store but
    also eviction. This process is useful for removing stale or unused data from
    the cache. Opposed to `cacheable`, the decorator `cache_evict` demarcates
    functions that perform cache eviction, which are functions that act as
    triggers for removing data from the cache. The `cache_evict` decorator not
    only allows a key to be specified, but also a set of keys. Besides, extra
    options like`all_entries` which indicates whether a cache-wide eviction
    needs to be performed rather than just an entry one (based on the key or
    keys):

        @decorate cache_evict(cache: Cache, key: {Account, email})
        def delete_account_by email(email) do
          # the logic for deleting the account ...
        end

        @decorate cacheable(cache: Cache, keys: [{Account, acct.id}, {Account, acct.email}])
        def delete_account(%Account{} = acct) do
          # the logic for deleting the account ...
        end

        @decorate cacheable(cache: Cache, all_entries: true)
        def delete_all_accounts do
          # the logic for deleting all the accounts ...
        end

    The option `all_entries:` comes in handy when an entire cache region needs
    to be cleared out - rather than evicting each entry (which would take a
    long time since it is inefficient), all the entries are removed in one
    operation as shown above.

    ## Shared Options

    All three cache annotations explained previously accept the following
    options:

      * `:cache` - Defines what cache to use (required). Raises `ArgumentError`
        if the option is not present.

      * `:key` - Defines the cache access key (optional). If this option
        is not present, a default key is generated by hashing the tuple
        `{module, fun_name}`; the first element is the caller module and the
        second one the function name (`:erlang.phash2({module, fun})`).

      * `:opts` - Defines the cache options that will be passed as argument
        to the invoked cache function (optional).

      * `:match` - Match function `(term -> boolean | {true, term})` (optional).
        This function is for matching and decide whether or not the code-block
        evaluation result is cached or not. If `true` the code-block evaluation
        result is cached as it is (the default). If `{true, value}` is returned,
        then the `value` is what is cached (useful to control what to cache).
        Otherwise, none result is stored in the cache.

    ## Putting all together

    Supposing we are using `Ecto` and we want to define some cacheable functions
    within the context `MyApp.Accounts`:

        # The config
        config :my_app, MyApp.Cache,
          gc_interval: 86_400_000, #=> 1 day
          backend: :shards

        # The Cache
        defmodule MyApp.Cache do
          use Nebulex.Cache,
            otp_app: :my_app,
            adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Local
        end

        # Some Ecto schema
        defmodule MyApp.Accounts.User do
          use Ecto.Schema

          schema "users" do
            field(:username, :string)
            field(:password, :string)
            field(:role, :string)
          end

          def changeset(user, attrs) do
            user
            |> cast(attrs, [:username, :password, :role])
            |> validate_required([:username, :password, :role])
          end
        end

        # Accounts context
        defmodule MyApp.Accounts do
          use Nebulex.Caching

          alias MyApp.Accounts.User
          alias MyApp.{Cache, Repo}

          @ttl Nebulex.Time.expiry_time(1, :hour)

          @decorate cacheable(cache: Cache, key: {User, id}, opts: [ttl: @ttl])
          def get_user!(id) do
            Repo.get!(User, id)
          end

          @decorate cacheable(cache: Cache, key: {User, username}, opts: [ttl: @ttl])
          def get_user_by_username(username) do
            Repo.get_by(User, [username: username])
          end

          @decorate cache_put(
                      cache: Cache,
                      keys: [{User, usr.id}, {User, usr.username}],
                      match: &match_update/1
                    )
          def update_user(%User{} = usr, attrs) do
            usr
            |> User.changeset(attrs)
            |> Repo.update()
          end

          defp match_update({:ok, usr}), do: {true, usr}
          defp match_update({:error, _}), do: false

          @decorate cache_evict(cache: Cache, keys: [{User, usr.id}, {User, usr.username}])
          def delete_user(%User{} = usr) do
            Repo.delete(usr)
          end

          def create_user(attrs \\ %{}) do
            %User{}
            |> User.changeset(attrs)
            |> Repo.insert()
          end
        end
